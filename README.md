The problem here is customers leaving. The solution is to predict a behavior to retain customers.
This is individual work.
I was able to load and explore the data, process the data, and split the dataset.
I used the random forest ensemble method but was unable to train the model.
Because of that I'm unable to test and evaluate the model.
